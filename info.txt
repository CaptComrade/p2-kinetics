Project 2 descriptions:
    Modeling kinetics: rate of change between things!
    
    A -> B -> C
    
The rates of change betweeen A->B and B->C Determine when we will see a certain concentration, AND the initial conditions. 

Species C:
    comes from a reaction from B->C
    
    Line 14 has k2*B in that big list that's returned
    That MEANS: dC/dt = k2 * B
    That means: Amount of C goes up over time, depending on how much B there is.
    k2 is a CONSTANT for this project
    
Species A: 
    dA/dt is in the first element of the list returned on line 14
    dA/dt = -k1*A*B/(A+B+C)
This reaction depends on the concentration of A and the concentration of B
concentration of A is A/(A+B+C), and the concentration of B is B/(A+B+C)

k1 and k2 are our reaction constantsk1 and k2 are our reaction constants
